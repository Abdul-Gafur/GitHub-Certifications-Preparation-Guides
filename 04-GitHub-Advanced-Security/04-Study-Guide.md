## Introduction to GitHub Administration

GitHub Administration involves optimizing and managing a healthy GitHub environment. It requires a deep understanding of repository management, workflow optimization, and efficient collaboration.

## Repository Management

Repository management involves creating and managing repositories, setting repository permissions, managing branches and releases, and more.

git init
```

## Workflow Optimization

Example of setting up a workflow with GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!
```

## Efficient Collaboration

Efficient collaboration involves managing teams and permissions, using pull requests and code reviews effectively, managing issues and labels, and more.
